# An example Jupyter Notebook to allow registering of JSON data within the resource-catalogue of an EOEPCA instance

With a running instance of the resource-catalogue in EOEPCA, you can select data from the CEDA STAC API to be registered within the resource-catalogue.
The notebook first registers the collection and then each of the items within this, including assets.
This forms the first step in potentially displaying such data within an EOX instance, available under the data-access service within EOEPCA.
